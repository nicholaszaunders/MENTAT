The major challenges in building metropolitan-scale quantum networks are compensation for polarization fluctuation, high-precision clock synchronization, and compensation for cumulative transmission time fluctuations. One approach addressing these challenges is to copropagate classical probe signals in the same fiber as the quantum signal. Thus, both signals experience the same conditions, and the changes of the fiber can therefore be monitored and compensated. Here, we demonstrate the distribution of polarization-entangled quantum signals copropagating with the White Rabbit precision time protocol classical signals in the same single-core fiber strand at metropolitan-scale distances. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this quantum-classical coexistence by achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution between nodes separated by 100 km of optical fiber. This advancement is a significant step towards the practical implementation of robust and efficient metropolitan-scale quantum networks.},

            Rapid development of supercomputers and the prospect of quantum computers are posing increasingly serious threats to the security of communication. Using the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum communication offers provable security of communication and is a promising solution to counter such threats. Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is one important branch of quantum communication. In contrast to other branches of quantum communication, it transmits secret information directly. Recently, remarkable progress has been made in proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations of QSDC. However, it remains a technical feat to bring QSDC into a practical application. Here, we report the implementation of a practical quantum secure communication system. The security is analyzed in the Wyner wiretap channel theory. The system uses a coding scheme of concatenation of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and works in a regime with a realistic environment of high noise and high loss. The present system operates with a repetition rate of 1 MHz at a distance of 1.5 kilometers. The secure communication rate is 50 bps, sufficient to effectively send text messages and reasonably sized files of images and sounds.},

            Rapid progress has been made in quantum secure direct communication in recent years. For practical application, it is important to improve the performances, such as the secure information rate and the communication distance. In this paper, we report an elaborate physical system design and protocol with much enhanced performance. This design increased the secrecy capacity greatly by achieving an ultra-low quantum bit error rate of {\textless}0.1\%, one order of magnitude smaller than that of existing systems. Compared to previous systems, the proposed scheme uses photonic time-bin and phase states, operating at 50 MHz of repetition rate, which can be easily upgraded to over 1 GHz using current on-the-shelf technology. The results of our experimentation demonstrate that the proposed system can tolerate more channel loss, from 5.1 dB, which is about 28.3 km in fiber in the previous scheme, to 18.4 dB, which corresponds to fiber length of 102.2 km. Thus, the experiment shows that intercity quantum secure direct communication through fiber is feasible with present-day technology.},

              Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) can guarantee security using the characteristics of quantum mechanics even when a message is directly transmitted through a quantum channel without using a secret key. However, the transmission rate of the QSDC is limited by the dead time of a single photon detector (SPD) as well as channel loss over the distance. To overcome this limited transmission rate, we propose a high-dimensional single photon-based QSDC protocol that applies two optical degrees of freedom: time and phase state. First, an
              N
              -dimensional time and phase state generation method that considers the dead time is proposed to minimize the measurement loss of a transmitted message. Second, among the two types of quantum states, the phase state with relatively low measurement efficiency is used only for eavesdropping detection, and the time state is used for sending messages with differential delay time bin-based encoding techniques. Lastly, we propose an efficient method for measuring
              N
              -dimensional time and phase-based quantum states and recovering classical bit information. This study performs security analysis against various attacks, and verifies the transmission rate improvement effect through simulation. The result indicates that our proposal can guarantee higher security and transmission rates compared to the conventional DL04 QSDC.},

We show that in such regime a joint measurement on the modes of a two-mode entangling cloner, being the optimal individual eavesdropping attack in a noisy Gaussian channel, is no more effective that independent measurements on the modes. Varying variance of the signal out of this regime, we observe the nontrivial statistical effects of either redundancy or synergy between the measurements of two modes of the entangling cloner. The result reveals the non-optimality of entangling cloner individual attack for sub-shot-noise modulated signals.

            In typical laser communications classical information is encoded by modulating the amplitude of the laser beam and measured via direct detection. We add a layer of security using quantum physics to this standard scheme, applicable to free-space channels. We consider a simultaneous classical-quantum communication scheme where the classical information is encoded in the usual way and the quantum information is encoded as fluctuations of a sub-Poissonian noise-floor. For secret key generation, we consider a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol (CVQKD) using a Gaussian ensemble of squeezed states and direct detection. Under the assumption of passive attacks secure key generation and classical communication can proceed simultaneously. Compared with standard CVQKD, which is secure against unrestricted attacks, our added layer of quantum security is simple to implement, robust and does not affect classical data rates. We perform detailed simulations of the performance of the protocol for a free-space atmospheric channel. We analyse security of the CVQKD protocol in the composable finite-size regime.},

Here we present a communication protocol that does not allow for any information leakage to a potential eavesdropper in a purely lossy channel. By encoding information into a restricted Gaussian alphabet of squeezed states we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the Holevo information between the eavesdropper and the intended recipient can be exactly zero in a purely lossy channel while minimized in a noisy channel. This result is of fundamental interest, but might also have practical implications in extending the distance of secure quantum key distribution.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In typical laser communications classical information is encoded by modulating the amplitude of the laser beam and measured via direct detection. We add a layer of security using quantum physics to this standard scheme, applicable to free-space channels. We consider a simultaneous classical-quantum communication scheme where the classical information is encoded in the usual way and the quantum information is encoded as fluctuations of a sub-Poissonian noise-floor. For secret key generation, we consider a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol (CVQKD) using a Gaussian ensemble of squeezed states and direct detection. Under the assumption of passive attacks secure key generation and classical communication can proceed simultaneously. Compared with standard CVQKD, which is secure against unrestricted attacks, our added layer of quantum security is simple to implement, robust and does not affect classical data rates. We perform detailed simulations of the performance of the protocol for a free-space atmospheric channel. We analyse security of the CVQKD protocol in the composable finite-size regime.},

The latter bounds were obtained as a solution of convex optimization problems and our new analytical bound matches the results of Ghorai

The more relevant case of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) could not be analyzed with the previous techniques, due to their large number of coherent states. Our bound shows that relatively small constellation sizes, with say 64 states, are essentially sufficient to obtain a performance close to a true Gaussian modulation and are therefore an attractive solution for large-scale deployment of continuous-variable quantum key distribution. We also derive similar bounds when the modulation consists of arbitrary states, not necessarily pure.},

              A quantum key distribution (QKD) system must fulfill the requirement of universal composability to ensure that any cryptographic application (using the QKD system) is also secure. Furthermore, the theoretical proof responsible for security analysis and key generation should cater to the number
              N
              of the distributed quantum states being finite in practice. Continuous-variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states, despite being a suitable candidate for integration in the telecom infrastructure, has so far been unable to demonstrate composability as existing proofs require a rather large
              N
              for successful key generation. Here we report a Gaussian-modulated coherent state CVQKD system that is able to overcome these challenges and can generate composable keys secure against collective attacks with
              N
               ≈ 2 × 10
              8
              coherent states. With this advance, possible due to improvements to the security proof and a fast, yet low-noise and highly stable system operation, CVQKD implementations take a significant step towards their discrete-variable counterparts in practicality, performance, and security.},

            The no-cloning theorem states that an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned exactly and deterministically due to the linearity of quantum mechanics. Associated with this theorem is the quantitative no-cloning limit that sets an upper bound to the quality of the generated clones. However, this limit can be circumvented by abandoning determinism and using probabilistic methods. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of probabilistic cloning of arbitrary coherent states that clearly surpasses the no-cloning limit. Our scheme is based on a hybrid linear amplifier that combines an ideal deterministic linear amplifier with a heralded measurement-based noiseless amplifier. We demonstrate the production of up to five clones with the fidelity of each clone clearly exceeding the corresponding no-cloning limit. Moreover, since successful cloning events are heralded, our scheme has the potential to be adopted in quantum repeater, teleportation and computing applications.},

In this Letter, we propose and experimentally realize a PSP CVQKD scheme with transmitted local oscillator (LO) through fluctuating transmittance free-space channel using an off-the-shelf amplified spontaneous emission source for the first time. By proposing thermal-state polarization multiplexing transmitted LO, synchronized channel transmittance monitoring and fine-grained phase compensation techniques, secure keys within −15 dB transmittance of simulated free-space channel with turbulence are generated, with a final average secure key rate of 1.015 Mbps asymptotically. Equivalent atmospheric turbulence model analysis shows that the free-space PSP CVQKD scheme provides a promising outlook for high-speed and chip-based CVQKD for kilometer-level atmospheric channel networks.},

In this paper, we propose an inter-satellite SQCC-CVQKD scheme in the terahertz (THz) band. This scheme performs classical modulation at the sending end, followed by quantum Gaussian modulation operations. At the receiving end, an amplifier is used to amplify and demultiplex the received signal, and, finally, a homodyne detector or heterodyne detector is selected for decoding. We have demonstrated the security of the SQCC-CVQKD system in the THz band, and a performance analysis of the scheme is given in the finite-size regime. The simulation results show that this scheme has a higher secret key rate and stronger anti-interference ability in practice. This work provides an effective way to construct wireless quantum communication networks.},

              A successful quantum communication network will rely on the ability to distribute entangled photons over large distances between receiver stations. So far, free-space demonstrations have been limited to line-of-sight links across cities or between mountaintops. Scattering and coherence decay have limited the link separations to around 100 km.

            Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to {\textasciitilde}100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.},

	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) which enables information-theoretically security is now heading towards quantum secure networks. It requires high-performance and cost-effective protocols while increasing the number of users. Unfortunately, qubit-implemented protocols only allow one receiver to respond to the prepared signal at a time, thus cannot support multiple users natively and well satisfy the network demands. Here, we show a 'protocol solution' using continuous-variable quantum information. A coherent-state point-to-multipoint protocol is proposed to simultaneously support multiple independent QKD links between a single transmitter and massive receivers. Every prepared coherent state is measured by all receivers to generate raw keys, then processed with a secure and high-efficient key distillation method to remove the correlations between different QKD links. It can achieve remarkably high key rates even with a hundred of access points and shows the potential improvement of two orders of magnitude. This scheme is a promising step towards a high-rate multi-user solution in a scalable quantum secure network.},

Continuous variable (CV) QKD with coherent states and coherent detection integrates well with existing telecommunication networks. However, thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex scheme where the local oscillator is transmitted, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting its potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100 km fiber channel with a total loss of 15.4 dB. This record-breaking distance is achieved by controlling the phase-noise-induced excess noise through a machine-learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We implement the full CV-QKD protocol and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in the finite-size regime. Our results mark a significant milestone for realizing CV quantum access networks with a high loss budget, and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QKD.},

            Quantum key distribution (QKD) using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum‐cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete‐variable QKD. This article reviews the theoretical foundations of continuous‐variable quantum key distribution (CV‐QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederives the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self‐contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre‐knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV‐QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well‐known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.},

            A prerequisite for universal quantum computation and other large-scale quantum information processors is the careful preparation of quantum states in massive numbers or of massive dimension. For continuous variable approaches to quantum information processing (QIP), squeezed states are the natural quantum resources, but most demonstrations have been based on a limited number of squeezed states due to the experimental complexity in up-scaling. The number of physical resources can however be significantly reduced by employing the technique of temporal multiplexing. Here, we demonstrate an application to continuous variable QIP of temporal multiplexing in fiber: Using just a single source of squeezed states in combination with active optical switching and a 200 m fiber delay line, we generate fiber-coupled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled quantum states. Our demonstration is a critical enabler for the construction of an in-fiber, all-purpose quantum information processor based on a single or few squeezed state quantum resources.},

	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two remote parties to share encryption keys with security based on the laws of physics. Continuous variable (CV) QKD with coherent states and coherent detection integrates well with existing telecommunication networks. However, thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex scheme where the local oscillator is transmitted, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting its potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100 km fiber channel with a total loss of 15.4 dB. This record-breaking distance is achieved by controlling the phase-noise-induced excess noise through a machine-learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We implement the full CV-QKD protocol and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in the finite-size regime. Our results mark a significant milestone for realizing CV quantum access networks with a high loss budget, and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QKD.},

            Quantum communications promises reliable transmission of quantum information, efficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure keys. For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point rates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum channel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted capacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum repeaters. Here, by constructing an upper bound based on the relative entropy of entanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed ‘teleportation stretching’, we establish these capacities for many fundamental channels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we exactly determine the fundamental rate-loss tradeoff affecting any protocol of quantum key distribution. Our findings set the limits of point-to-point quantum communications and provide precise and general benchmarks for quantum repeaters.},

The ultimate end-to-end rates of quantum repeater networks are known to be achievable by an optimal entanglement-distillation protocol followed by quantum teleportation. In this thesis, we give physical repeater designs for this achievability. We also propose practical repeater designs with near-term potential for real-world practical applications.},

In our approach, the probabilistic noiseless quantum amplification operation is encoded into a suitable auxiliary two-mode entangled state and then applied to the input coherent state via continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The scheme requires conditioning on the outcomes of homodyne measurements in the teleportation protocol. In contrast to high-fidelity noiseless quantum amplifiers based on combination of conditional single-photon addition and subtraction, the present scheme requires only photon subtraction in combination with auxiliary Gaussian squeezed vacuum states. We first provide a pure-state description of the protocol which allows us to to clearly explain its principles and functioning. Next we develop a more comprehensive model based on phase-space representation of quantum states, that accounts for various experimental imperfections such as excess noise in the auxiliary squeezed states or limited efficiency of the single-photon detectors that can only distinguish the presence or absence of photons. We present and analyze predictions of this phase-space model of the noiseless teleamplifier.},

Quantum repeaters, i.e., untrusted, intermediate relay stations, are necessary to overcome the repeaterless bound which sets the fundamental rate-distance limit of repeaterless communications. In this work, we introduce a continuous-variable protocol which overcomes the repeaterless bound and scales like the single-repeater bound using just one linear-optical device called a "quantum scissor", combining the entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping elements of previous repeater proposals into a single step, thus, removing the need for quantum memories. Implementing a standard continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol using our repeater we predict key rates which surpass the repeaterless bound. Our protocol works well for non-ideal single-photon sources and non-ideal single-photon detectors, and can tolerate some level of excess noise, making our protocol implementable with existing technology. We show that our scheme can be extended to longer repeater chains using quantum memories, using less physical resources than previous schemes. Furthermore, for applications beyond key distribution, our scheme generalises to higher order and distils more entanglement at the cost of a reduced probability of success.},

In particular, we consider the realistic condition of non-unit quantum efficiency for the homodyne detectors. This formula can easily be specialized to describe the standard Bell measurement and the heterodyne detection, which are exploited in many contexts, including protocols of quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography. In its general form, our formula can be adopted to study quantum information protocols in the presence of experimental imperfections and asymmetric setups, e.g., deriving from the use of unbalanced beam splitters.},

            Advances in highly sensitive detection techniques for classical coherent communication systems have reduced the received signal power requirements to a few photons per bit. At this level one can take advantage of the quantum noise to create secure communication, using continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). In this work therefore we embed CV-QKD signals within classical signals and transmit classical data and secure keys simultaneously over 25 km of optical fibre. This is achieved by using a novel coherent displacement state generator, which has the potential for being used in a wide range of quantum optical experiments. This approach removes the need for separate channels for quantum communication systems and allows reduced system bandwidth for a given communications specification. This demonstration therefore demonstrates a way of implementing direct quantum physical layer security within a conventional classical communications system, offering a major advance in term of practical and low cost implementation.},

            Simultaneous two-way classical and quantum (STCQ) communication combines both continuous classical coherent optical communication and continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which eliminates all detection-related imperfections by being measurement-device-independent (MDI). In this paper, we propose a protocol relying on STCQ communication on the oceanic quantum channel, in which the superposition-modulation-based coherent states depend on the information bits of both the secret key and the classical communication ciphertext. We analyse the encoding combination in classical communication and consider the probability distribution transmittance under seawater turbulence with various interference factors. Our numerical simulations of various practical scenarios demonstrate that the proposed protocol can simultaneously enable two-way classical communication and CV-MDI QKD with just a slight performance degradation transmission distance compared to the original CV-MDI QKD scheme. Moreover, the asymmetric situation outperforms the symmetric case in terms of transmission distance and optical modulation variance. We further take into consideration the impact of finite-size effects to illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme in practical scenarios. The results show the feasibility of the underwater STCQ scheme, which contributes toward developing a global quantum communication network in free space.},

Our scheme is a generalisation of the multi-photon quantum scissor teleamplifier, which we implement using a coherent state superposition resource state. Furthermore, we prove our NLA is also a loss-tolerant relay for multi-ary phase-shift keyed coherent states.

Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and protocols based on continuous-variable systems.

Our channel estimation is based on an optimal estimate of the relevant decoherence parameter via its quantum Fisher information. Using state-of-the art quantum LDPC codes designed for the quantum depolarization channel, and utilizing various quantum probes with different entanglement properties, we show how the performance of such codes can deteriorate by an order of magnitude when optimal channel identification is fed into a belief propagation decoding algorithm. Our work highlights the importance in quantum communications of a viable channel identification campaign prior to decoding, and highlights the trade-off between entanglement consumption and quantum LDPC code performance.},

            Long-distance optical quantum channels are necessarily lossy, leading to errors in transmitted quantum information, entanglement degradation and, ultimately, poor protocol performance. Quantum states carrying information in the channel can be probabilistically amplified to compensate for loss, but are destroyed when amplification fails. Quantum correction of the channel itself is therefore required, but break-even performance—where arbitrary states can be better transmitted through a corrected channel than an uncorrected one—has so far remained out of reach. Here we perform distillation by heralded amplification to improve a noisy entanglement channel. We subsequently employ entanglement swapping to demonstrate that arbitrary quantum information transmission is unconditionally improved—i.e., without relying on postselection or post-processing of data—compared to the uncorrected channel. In this way, it represents realization of a genuine quantum relay. Our channel correction for single-mode quantum states will find use in quantum repeater, communication and metrology applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the combination of zero-photon catalysis (ZPC) and a quantum scissors (QS) intensifies the range and the fidelity of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution CV-QKD protocol. Using a non-Gaussian calculation, we realized that the QS significantly boosts the range of the protocol and enhances its fidelity at long distances. At negligible values of excess noise, ZPC operation leads to incredibly high fidelity values, even at large distances. In this case, an optimal strength of the ZPC operation exists that maximizes the secure distance of the protocol. Finally, our study of a system with a nonzero value of excess noise reveals that the fidelity generally increases with ZPC, as opposed to the range, which decreases with this Gaussian operation.},

	abstract = {This thesis analyses continuous-variable (CV) entanglement distribution over atmospheric-fading channels dominated by turbulence-induced beam wandering, and its application to entanglement-based CV quantum key distribution (QKD). The first contribution of this thesis is to quantify Gaussian entanglement between two ground stations generated via various quantum communication schemes, where communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric channels. In one scheme the quantum complexity remains largely on the ground, with the satellite acting as a reflector. On the receiving ground station we apply classical and quantum post-selection, demonstrating the better performance of classical post-selection in enhancing the Gaussian entanglement between the stations relative to quantum post-selection. Then, by considering CV-QKD based on the Gaussian entanglement between the ground stations, we present the first quantitative assessment of key rates in the scenario of reflection off the satellite. We compare the Gaussian entanglement produced by this scheme with two other schemes, in which quantum complexity is added to the satellite, illustrating the tradeoff between space-based quantum complexity and the Gaussian entanglement. The second contribution is to determine CV-QKD key rates between two ground stations resulting from a measurement-device independence (MDI) protocol which utilizes Gaussian states. In this MDI protocol the measurement device is a satellite communicating with the ground stations over two independent atmospheric channels. The MDI protocol we study is useful since we show that key rates between the stations are possible even when the satellite is held by an adversary. The security of the protocol is confirmed through an equivalent entanglement swapping scheme. The third contribution is to determine entanglement-generation rates and quantum key rates via non-Gaussian transfer over atmospheric channels. Utilizing a Kraus representation of the channel, we present the first quantitative assessment of non Gaussian entanglement evolution through atmospheric channels. Most of the non-Gaussian states we transmit over the channel are created just-in-time via non-Gaussian operations on input Gaussian states that would otherwise be used directly in the channel. In such an operational scenario we show sending the incoming Gaussian state directly over the channel would be the best option in terms of the entanglement-generation rate.},
