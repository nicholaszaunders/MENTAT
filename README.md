# MENTAT: a *Mathematica*-based human-accessible computer algebra system for Fock state computation

## Overview

MENTAT is a computer algebra system for *Mathematica* 14.1, designed with the aim of closely mimicking the familiar process of doing pen-and-paper Fock-state calculations while leveraging Mathematica's computational efficiency for symbolic algebra calculation. 

MENTAT allows users to freely define fully generalised quantum states, operations, and measurements by simply writing them down, without any prerequisite knowledge of a specialised API or code structure. Since it is possible to build most Fock-space operations out of only a few primitives, the limiting factor in what functionality MENTAT can offer is only the userâ€™s imagination. MENTAT also offers functionality for a variety of common operators and processes found in theoretical quantum optics, such as conjugate transposition, inner and outer vector products, tensor products, etc. as well as shortcuts for common quantum operations and states such as coherent states, beamsplitters, partial tracing of states, calculation of von Neumann entropy, and more.

## Installation and testing

MENTAT is provided as a pre-built *Mathematica* 14.1 package file. To use MENTAT in a Mathematica notebook, simply run the following line at the beginning of the document:

```
<< "path\\MENTAT.wl"
```

where `path` is the directory location of the folder in which the MENTAT.wl file is stored, e.g. `C:\\Users\\user\\...`, etc. The package has been imported successfully when running the above command shows the welcome message. You can also check that the package is working correctly by referencing the included test notebook [test-suite.nb](https://github.com/nicholaszaunders/MENTAT/blob/main/test-suite.nb).

MENTAT requires Mathematica version 14.1.
